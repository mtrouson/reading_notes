Learning how to remove Malware is an essential skill that every cybersecurity professional should know because of the high probability of computers that get infected especially with remote and telework trending upwards. This article shows a step by step play of how to remove Malware from your PC. 

“Step 1: Enter Safe Mode
-Before you do anything, you need to disconnect your PC from the internet, and don’t use it until you’re ready to clean your PC.

Step 2: Delete temporary files
-Now that you’re in Safe Mode, you’ll want to run a virus scan. But before you do that, delete your temporary files.

Step 3: Download malware scanners
-You should have only one real-time antivirus program installed at a time, but you can have many on-demand scanners installed to run scans with multiple programs, thereby ensuring that if one program misses something a different one might find it.

Step 4: Run a scan with Malwarebytes
- If you disconnected from the internet for safety reasons when you first suspected that you might be infected, reconnect to it so you can download, install, and update Malwarebytes; then disconnect from the internet again before you start the actual scanning.

Step 5: Fix your web browser
-Malware infections can damage Windows system files and other settings.

Step 6: Recover your files if Windows is corrupt
- But before wiping your hard drive, copy all of your files to an external USB or flash drive. 

Step 7: Keep your PC clean
Always make sure that you have a real-time antivirus program running on your PC, and make sure this program is always up-to-date.”(Eric Geier and Josh Norem 2019)
