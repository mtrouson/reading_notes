Virtualization has become an evolution of services that have been built on its backbone, to include “network, storage, data devices, as well applications (through app virtualization – software encapsulation from the underlying operating system)”.(Jarosciak 2017). With a huge market shift predicted in 2023 of majority companies having some aspect of their business to exist in the cloud, there will be an even greater demand to keep that data secure. This article shares the relationship between the conception of Virtualization and how companies like Amazon that have built onto the Virtualization framework. “The concept of virtualization goes back to the 1960s, but it was popularized by VMWare in 1999 when it was introduced to cheap Intel® hardware, which allowed anyone to virtualize a traditional computer with all its resources.”(Jarosciak 2017)

“The Amazon IaaS cloud service model is characterized by delivering virtualized computer infrastructure in the form of a service. A good example of the virtualization of Amazon AWS services is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which is essentially an IaaS service that provides virtual servers based on the Xen hypervisor”. “Another critical part of the entire process of virtualization in Amazon EC2 is Amazon Machine Image (AMI), which is also a virtual appliance. However, AMI is mainly responsible for creating on-demand virtual machines within the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud.” (Jarosciak 2017)

“As we can see, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) would not exist without the virtualization which is right at the core of IaaS cloud model and the EC2 implementation at Amazon. Virtualization allows Amazon to run different types of virtual machines of various sizes on top of their hardware. It’s safe to say, that Amazon heavily uses virtualization through capabilities offered by Xen hypervisor and Amazon AMI.” (Jarosciak 2017)
